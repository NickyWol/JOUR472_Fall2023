## Introduction

In this notebook, we are reverse engineering the story, Thousands of kids are missing from school. Where did they go? (<https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/missing-children/index.html>)

## Load libraries

Loading required libraries for this analysis.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)


```

## Load and Cleaning Data

In this section, describe the source of the data, write a basic data dictionary for data you are working with, and discuss any caveats or issues you discovered working with this data.

```{r}
# Load required data

population_by_age <- read.csv('data/population-by-age.csv') |>
  clean_names()
private_enrollment_by_grade <- read.csv('data/private-enrollment-by-grade.csv') |>
  clean_names()
public_enrollment_by_grade <- read.csv('data/public-enrollment-by-grade.csv') |>
  clean_names() 
missing_kids_analysis <- read.csv('data/Missing-Kids-Analysis.csv') |>
  clean_names()
school_aged_population_changes <- read.csv('data/School-Aged-Population-Changes.csv') |>
  clean_names()
enrollment_changes <- read.csv('data/Enrollment-Changes.csv') |>
  clean_names()


# Path to data should be loaded from folder "data" i.e. read_csv("data/name_of_data.csv")

# Clean required data and prepare for analysis if needed. 


```

## Sentences to Engineer

In this notebook, we are reverse engineering five sentences from the story.

### Sentence 1

-   **Sentence text**: "Overall, public school enrollment fell by over 700,000 students between the 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 school years in the 21 states plus Washington, D.C., that provided the necessary data."
-   **Analysis summary**: We utilized data from the data set 'enrollment_changes' and compared it to the data set 'missing_kids_analysis'. We were able to find the number of children who left public schools between the 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 school years, and it matched the number featured in the story.

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

enrollment_changes |>
  group_by(enrollment_type) |>
  filter(enrollment_type == 'Public school enrollment') |>
  filter(state_abbrev == 'CA' | state_abbrev == 'NY' | state_abbrev == 'LA' | state_abbrev == 'NC' | state_abbrev == 'WA' | state_abbrev == 'CO' | state_abbrev == 'GA' | state_abbrev == 'MN' | state_abbrev == 'WI' | state_abbrev == 'NH' | state_abbrev == 'MA' | state_abbrev == 'MT' | state_abbrev == 'DE' | state_abbrev == 'ND' | state_abbrev == 'DC' | state_abbrev == 'SD' | state_abbrev == 'SC' | state_abbrev == 'NE' | state_abbrev == 'RI' | state_abbrev == 'TN' | state_abbrev == 'PA' | state_abbrev == 'FL') |>
  summarise(sum(total_change))

# Display results of code below this codeblock

```

### Sentence 2

-   **Sentence text**: "Those states saw private-school enrollment grow by over 100,000 students. Home-schooling grew even more, surging by more than 180,000 from 2019-2020 to 2021-2022."
-   **Analysis summary**: We used the enrollment_changes data set to find the differences is private/homeschooled kids between the 2019 school year and the 2021 school year, confirming the private school enrollment did grow by over 100,000 students and home-schooling did grow by more than 180,000 students.

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

enrollment_changes |>
  filter(enrollment_type == 'Private enrollment') |>
  filter(state_abbrev == 'CA' | state_abbrev == 'NY' | state_abbrev == 'LA' | state_abbrev == 'NC' | state_abbrev == 'WA' | state_abbrev == 'CO' | state_abbrev == 'GA' | state_abbrev == 'MN' | state_abbrev == 'WI' | state_abbrev == 'NH' | state_abbrev == 'MA' | state_abbrev == 'MT' | state_abbrev == 'DE' | state_abbrev == 'ND' | state_abbrev == 'DC' | state_abbrev == 'SD' | state_abbrev == 'SC' | state_abbrev == 'NE' | state_abbrev == 'RI' | state_abbrev == 'TN' | state_abbrev == 'PA' | state_abbrev == 'FL') |>
  summarise(sum(total_change))
  

enrollment_changes |>
  filter(enrollment_type == 'Homeschool enrollment') |>
  filter(state_abbrev == 'CA' | state_abbrev == 'NY' | state_abbrev == 'LA' | state_abbrev == 'NC' | state_abbrev == 'WA' | state_abbrev == 'CO' | state_abbrev == 'GA' | state_abbrev == 'MN' | state_abbrev == 'WI' | state_abbrev == 'NH' | state_abbrev == 'MA' | state_abbrev == 'MT' | state_abbrev == 'DE' | state_abbrev == 'ND' | state_abbrev == 'DC' | state_abbrev == 'SD' | state_abbrev == 'SC' | state_abbrev == 'NE' | state_abbrev == 'RI' | state_abbrev == 'TN' | state_abbrev == 'PA' | state_abbrev == 'FL') |>
  summarize(sum(total_change))

```

### Sentence 3

-   **Sentence text**: "California alone showed over 150,000 missing students in the data, and New York had nearly 60,000."
-   **Analysis summary**: 

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here
public_enrollment_changes <- enrollment_changes |>
  filter(enrollment_type =='Public school enrollment') |>
  filter(state_abbrev == 'CA' | state_abbrev == 'NY') |>
  select(state,total_change)

non_public_enrollment_changes <- enrollment_changes |>
  filter(enrollment_type =='Total nonpublic enrollment (private + homeschool)') |>
  filter(state_abbrev == 'CA' | state_abbrev == 'NY') |>
  select(state,total_change)

enrollment_changes_ca_ny <- non_public_enrollment_changes |>
  inner_join(public_enrollment_changes, by = 'state')

school_age_change <- school_aged_population_changes |>
  filter(state == 'California' | state == 'New York') |>
  select(state,change_in_school_aged_population_5_17)

age_enrollment_change <- enrollment_changes_ca_ny |>
  inner_join(school_age_change, by= 'state')

```

### Sentence 4

-   **Sentence text**: "The population of school-age kids in the states we studied fell by about 183,000, according to census estimates."
-   **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis. Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

# Display results of code below this codeblock

```

### Sentence 5

-   **Sentence text**: [Paste in sentence to engineer here]
-   **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis. Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here
